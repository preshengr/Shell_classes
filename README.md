# A WARM WELCOME
- Welcome to the personal Repo for Presh Engr.
- This is a private repo, designed to handle all the trainings and tutorials learnt from the alx classes
- This Repo is the shell Repo which is the first step to understanding the Linux enviroment and all its features.
- There are certain levels that we have attained and must be maintained and to do so you have to workout each session of your life with sincere touch and unprecendented diligence.

# WHAT TO EXPEECT
- You are to expect personal definitions.
- Explanations defined to my own way not the general way
- Files created in error and how they were corrected.
- Expect to see some messed up jobs but then there must be a way out from it.

# WHY THE REPO
- Well since we are in a digital age we cannot predict when we could be in need of certain steps, therefore the best way to store them is to keep them on a secured server
- We are using our github as a storage unit to keep all actions for future reference.

# WHAT YOU WILL NOT SEE.
- There will be no copy and paste.
- There will be no photocopy
- There will be no less standard of doing things.
- What ever must be done will be done perfectly and properly. We are Ready for the action.
